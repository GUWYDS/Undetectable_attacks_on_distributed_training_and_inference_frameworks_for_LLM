The electrocardiogram and X-ray were normal. He ate well and slept well. But when he bent over, he was very painful. CT said that the L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1 were slightly protruding, and the nerve was pressed. The doctor said it was a protruding intervertebral disc, and suggested surgery. The patient said that the surgery was too expensive, and he did not want to do it. He asked the doctor if he could stimulate it with a needle. The doctor said it could.
